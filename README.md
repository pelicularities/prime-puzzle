# A simple prime number kata
I did a technical assessment that involved a simple prime number kata. There were a range of languages I could pick from, so I chose Ruby, because 1. that's what I was most comfortable with and 2. Ruby's standard library includes a '[prime](https://github.com/ruby/prime/blob/master/lib/prime.rb)' library, which includes such glorious methods as #prime?

After completing the assessment, I wanted to see if I could do it without the prime library. That is all.

Using the prime library is still the more performant solution. Moral of the story: use a library when you can, because chances are someone smarter than you has already done the work.
